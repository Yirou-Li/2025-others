# 2025-others
#Codon Optimization Tool

#This repository contains a Python script for codon optimization of foreign genes based on the codon usage of a given species. The tool calculates the codon usage frequency from a CDS (coding sequence) FASTA file, optimizes a foreign gene sequence, and generates visualizations and tables for analysis.

#Features

#Codon Usage Calculation: Computes the codon usage frequency from a CDS FASTA file.
#Codon Optimization: Optimizes a foreign gene sequence by replacing codons with the most frequently used synonymous codons.
#Visualization: Generates bar charts for codon usage frequency and line plots for CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) values.
#Output Files: Saves the codon usage table, optimized sequence, and CAI values in text files.
#Requirements

#Python 3.7+
#Biopython (pip install biopython)
#Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)

#Usage

Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/codon-optimization.git
cd codon-optimization
Run the Script: Modify the cds_fasta and foreign_gene variables in the script to point to your input files. Then run:
python codon_optimization.py
Output Files:
codon_usage.txt: Codon usage frequency table.
optimized_seq.txt: Optimized foreign gene sequence.
cai_values.txt: CAI values for the original and optimized sequences.
codon_usage_*.png: Bar charts for codon usage frequency of each amino acid.
cai_plot.png: Line plot comparing CAI values of the original and optimized sequences.
